<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	This project is designed to generate webpages best on all the githhub repositories of a user. This allows for Easy updating and universal stlyes for all pages as well as less work for maintence for each individual project. 
</p>
<p>
	First using pyHTML i generated a simple html tamplate. Then using pygithub i pull down the title of each project and the readme (to be used as the description). I then put these in to the html template. After some styling you get a simple accesable page for each of your github repositories.
